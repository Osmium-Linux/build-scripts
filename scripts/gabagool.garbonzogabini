Mass can be converted into energy, and vice versa. This means that mass and energy are different manifestations of the same concept. This is shown by the fact that a mass with a higher energy distorts space-time more.

The big-bang was an explosion of energy and matter from an infinitely small point in space.

Energy and matter both distort spacetime, and are different manifestations of the same concept. This could be used to say that in reality, all the energy and matter in the universe are still at the infinitely small point at which they started, and the distance between everything is simply them distorting spacetime to spread apart, meaning that in reality, distance as a concept is flawed and does not match reality.
